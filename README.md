# Boids Project
Generated by [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) 7.2.1.

## Getting Started
To build the place from scratch, use:

```bash
rojo build -o "Boids Project.rbxlx"
```

Next, open `Boids Project.rbxlx` in Roblox Studio and start the Rojo server:

```bash
rojo serve
```

Finally, in Roblox Studio change the FLIGHT_ANIMATION_ID and FLIGHT_IDLE_ANIMATION_ID entries in the Constants module located in StartPlayer.StarterPlayerScipts.Modules to animations available to you.
